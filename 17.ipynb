    "\n",
    "1. **Tagged Group (Capturing Group)**: A tagged group is created by enclosing a part of the regular expression in parentheses `( )`. It captures the text that matches the enclosed pattern and allows you to access the captured text as a separate group in the match result.

    "       print(captured_text)  # Output: '50'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Tagged Group (Non-Capturing Group)**: A non-tagged group is created by using `(?: )` instead of `( )`. It groups the enclosed pattern without capturing the matched text as a separate group in the match result. Non-tagged groups are used when you want to group parts of the regular expression for logical grouping or applying quantifiers without capturing the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example with non-tagged group:\n",

    "   text = \"The price is $50 and $25 for additional items.\"\n",

    "       print(matched_text)  # Output: '$50'\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "In a simple match where you are not interested in capturing and extracting specific parts of the matched text, the choice between tagged (capturing) and non-tagged (non-capturing) groups is often a matter of personal coding style and readability. If you don't need to capture the matched text for later use, using a non-tagged group is a reasonable choice for logical grouping or applying quantifiers without affecting the match result.

    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Readability**: Named groups make the regular expression pattern more human-readable. Instead of referring to groups by numeric indices, you can use descriptive names that convey the purpose of each group. This makes it easier for others (and your future self) to understand the intent of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Documenting**: Named groups act as self-documentation for the regular expression. By using meaningful names for groups, you provide a clear explanation of what each group captures, which can serve as inline documentation for the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Easier Maintenance**: When you revisit or update your regular expressions, using named groups reduces the risk of errors. You don't have to worry about renumbering groups if you add, remove, or reorder them in the pattern. Named groups are less prone to breaking when the pattern changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Accessibility**: Named groups are accessible in a more structured and intuitive way within your code. You can access captured text using the names as keys, which is more intuitive than using numeric indices, especially when dealing with complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoid Confusion**: In patterns with multiple capturing groups, using numeric indices can lead to confusion, especially when groups are nested or when the pattern evolves over time. Named groups help prevent such confusion by providing clear labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reuse**: Named groups allow you to reuse the same group name in different parts of the pattern, capturing different content. This can be valuable when you need to extract various pieces of information with similar formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you want to extract dates from a text in the format \"MM/DD/YYYY.\" Using named groups, you can create a more readable and maintainable pattern:\n",

    "\n",
    "text = \"Event on 07/15/2023 and meeting on 12/31/2023\"\n",
