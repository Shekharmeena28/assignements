    "The purpose of the `try` statement in Python is to define a block of code where you anticipate that exceptions (errors) may occur during execution. It allows you to handle these exceptions gracefully rather than letting them propagate and potentially crash your program. The `try` statement is an essential part of Python's exception handling mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the `try` statement works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Try Block**: You enclose the code that you want to monitor for exceptions within a `try` block. This block typically contains statements that might raise exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "   except SomeExceptionType as e:\n",
    "       # Exception handling code\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Except Block(s)**: Immediately following the `try` block, you can include one or more `except` blocks. Each `except` block is used to catch and handle specific types of exceptions. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, Python will check each `except` block to see if it matches the type of the raised exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If an exception of the specified type is raised, the corresponding `except` block's code is executed.\n",
    "   - You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions, allowing you to handle different error scenarios gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optional `else` Block**: You can include an optional `else` block after all the `except` blocks. The code in the `else` block is executed if no exceptions occurred in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "   except SomeExceptionType as e:\n",
    "       # Exception handling code\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       # Code to run if no exceptions occurred\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional `finally` Block**: You can include an optional `finally` block at the end of the `try` statement. The code in the `finally` block always executes, whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used for cleanup and resource release tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "   except SomeExceptionType as e:\n",
    "       # Exception handling code\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Code that always executes, whether there was an exception or not\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try` statement allows you to handle exceptions in a controlled and structured way, making your code more robust and preventing crashes due to unexpected errors. It's a fundamental part of Python's error-handling capabilities and is used extensively in real-world applications to handle exceptional conditions gracefully."

    "\n",
    "1. **Basic `try`...`except` Block**:\n",
    "   - This is the most common and straightforward usage of the `try` statement.\n",
    "   - It consists of a `try` block followed by one or more `except` blocks that handle specific exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   except AnotherExceptionType as e:\n",
    "       # Exception handling code for AnotherExceptionType\n",

    "\n",
    "   In this variation, you specify one or more `except` blocks to catch and handle specific types of exceptions. If an exception of a matching type occurs within the `try` block, the corresponding `except` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`try`...`except`...`else`...`finally` Block**:\n",
    "   - This variation extends the basic `try`...`except` block by adding an `else` block and a `finally` block.\n",
    "   - It allows you to add additional functionality:\n",
    "     - The `else` block contains code that runs when no exceptions occur in the `try` block.\n",
    "     - The `finally` block contains code that always runs, whether there were exceptions or not, and is often used for cleanup tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "   except SomeExceptionType as e:\n",

    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Cleanup or finalization code that always runs\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this variation, the `else` block is executed when no exceptions are raised in the `try` block, and the `finally` block always runs, regardless of exceptions. This allows you to ensure that certain tasks (e.g., resource cleanup) are performed reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two variations of the `try` statement cover a wide range of exception-handling scenarios in Python, making it possible to handle exceptions gracefully and maintain program stability. Depending on your specific requirements, you can choose the appropriate variation and structure your exception handling accordingly."

    "The `raise` statement in Python is used to raise exceptions explicitly within your code. Its primary purpose is to signal that an exceptional condition has occurred, allowing you to control how these exceptions are handled further up the call stack. In essence, the `raise` statement allows you to create and trigger exceptions programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key purposes and use cases of the `raise` statement include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Raising Built-in Exceptions**: You can use `raise` to raise one of Python's built-in exception types when a specific error condition occurs in your code. This is especially useful when you want to provide meaningful error messages and context to indicate what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if some_condition:\n",
    "       raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: some_condition is True\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Raising Custom Exceptions**: You can define custom exception classes by creating a subclass of `BaseException` or one of its derived classes (e.g., `Exception`, `ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc.). Then, you can use `raise` to raise instances of these custom exceptions to represent specific error conditions in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "       pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   if some_condition:\n",
    "       raise MyCustomError(\"An error occurred: some_condition is True\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Propagation of Exceptions**: In complex programs with multiple levels of function calls, you can use `raise` to propagate exceptions up the call stack. When an exception is raised, it will continue to propagate through the calling functions until it is caught and handled by an appropriate `try`...`except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def some_function():\n",
    "       # ...\n",
    "       if error_condition:\n",
    "           raise ValueError(\"Error in some_function\")\n",
    "       # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "   def main():\n",
    "       try:\n",
    "           some_function()\n",
    "       except ValueError as e:\n",
    "           print(f\"Caught an error: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adding Context**: By using `raise` with a custom exception, you can add context information to the exception message, making it easier to debug and understand the cause of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, message, context_info):\n",
    "           super().__init__(message)\n",
    "           self.context_info = context_info\n",
    "\n",
    "   if some_condition:\n",
    "       context = {\"line_number\": 42, \"file_name\": \"example.py\"}\n",
    "       raise MyCustomError(\"An error occurred\", context)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `raise` statement is a powerful tool for handling exceptional conditions in your Python code. It allows you to create, customize, and raise exceptions to indicate errors or exceptional situations explicitly. This, in turn, enables you to write robust error-handling code and provide meaningful information about what went wrong in your programs."

    "The `assert` statement in Python is used for debugging and sanity checking purposes. It tests whether a given condition is `True`, and if it is not, it raises an `AssertionError` exception with an optional error message. The `assert` statement is similar in purpose to the `if` statement, but it is specifically designed for scenarios where you want to verify that certain conditions hold true during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the syntax of the `assert` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert condition, message\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `condition`: The Boolean expression that you want to check. If it evaluates to `False`, an `AssertionError` is raised.\n",
    "- `message` (optional): An optional error message that provides additional context about the failed assertion. This message is displayed when the `AssertionError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how the `assert` statement is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_average(values):\n",
    "    assert len(values) > 0, \"List must not be empty\"\n",
    "    total = sum(values)\n",
    "    return total / len(values)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = calculate_average([10, 20, 30])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `assert` statement checks whether the length of the `values` list is greater than zero. If the condition is `False` (i.e., the list is empty), an `AssertionError` is raised with the specified error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `assert` statement is similar in purpose to the `if` statement but is typically used during development and debugging to catch programming errors, violations of assumptions, or unexpected states in your code. When your code is running in \"optimally working\" conditions, assertions should not fail. However, if they do fail, it indicates a potential bug or issue in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that assertions can be disabled globally in Python by using the `-O` (optimize) command-line switch or by setting the `PYTHONOPTIMIZE` environment variable to a non-empty string. In optimized mode, assertions are not evaluated, which means they won't raise `AssertionError` exceptions. Therefore, it's best to use assertions primarily for debugging and testing purposes rather than relying on them for essential program logic or error handling in production code."

    "The `with` statement in Python is used for simplifying the management of resources, such as files, network connections, or database connections, by ensuring that they are properly acquired and released.

    "- `alias`: Specifies a variable name that is used to refer to the resource within the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the `with/as` argument is to provide a clear and structured way to manage resources, ensuring that they are properly initialized and cleaned up, even if exceptions occur within the context. It simplifies resource management by abstracting away the details of acquiring and releasing resources.\n",
