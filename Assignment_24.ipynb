    "Both def statements and lambda expressions are used to define functions in Python. However, there are some differences between the two.\n",

    "def statements are used to define named functions that can take arguments and return values. They are typically used for larger and more complex functions that need to be defined and used multiple times throughout a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expressions, on the other hand, are used to define small, anonymous functions that are typically used only once, usually as arguments to other functions. They can also take arguments and return values, but they are defined inline and don't have a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, def statements are more flexible and can be used for a wider range of functions, while lambda expressions are more concise and are useful for functions that are simple and don't need to be defined elsewhere in a program."
