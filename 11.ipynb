    "A metaclass in Python is a class for classes. It controls the creation, behavior, and structure of classes. Metaclasses are used to customize how classes are created and can enforce coding standards, add methods to classes, implement design patterns, and more. Metaclasses are implemented as classes themselves, with the built-in `type` class being the default metaclass. You can define your own metaclasses to tailor class behavior and attributes. They are a powerful but advanced feature and should be used sparingly."

    "   - Metaclasses are typically associated with class-level behaviors and attributes.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - In some cases, class decorators can be used to customize instance behavior indirectly by modifying class attributes or methods.\n",
    "   - For example, a class decorator can add instance methods or attributes to a class, which will then be available to instances of that class.\n",
