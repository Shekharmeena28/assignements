    "In Python, class-based exceptions that have been raised are matched to exception handlers using a mechanism known as exception handling or exception propagation. This mechanism allows you to define and organize exception handlers based on the type or class of exceptions, enabling you to catch and handle specific types of exceptions while letting others propagate up the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how class-based exceptions are matched to handlers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Raising an Exception**:\n",
    "   - When an exceptional condition occurs in your code, you can raise an exception by using the `raise` statement. You can raise either built-in exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`) or custom exceptions (user-defined exceptions by creating exception classes that inherit from built-in exceptions).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   raise SomeException(\"An error occurred\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Propagation Up the Call Stack**:\n",
    "   - Once an exception is raised, Python searches for the nearest enclosing `try`...`except` block that matches the type (class) of the exception. It does this by examining the type hierarchy of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matching Exception Type**:\n",
    "   - Python checks each `except` block in the order they appear, starting from the innermost (closest) one and moving outward. It compares the type of the raised exception to the types specified in each `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "   except SomeException as e:\n",
    "       # Handle SomeException\n",
    "   except AnotherException as e:\n",
    "       # Handle AnotherException\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, if `SomeException` is raised, it will be matched to the first `except` block because it specifies `SomeException`. If `AnotherException` is raised, it will be matched to the second `except` block because it specifies `AnotherException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handler Code Execution**:\n",
    "   - When a matching `except` block is found, the code within that block is executed to handle the exception. You can access the exception object (usually assigned to a variable, e.g., `e`) to obtain additional information about the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Propagation to Outer Blocks**:\n",
    "   - If no matching `except` block is found in the current scope, Python continues to search in the enclosing (outer) scopes. This continues until a matching `except` block is found or until the exception reaches the top-level scope. If no matching handler is found, the program terminates, and an unhandled exception message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Optional `else` and `finally` Blocks**:\n",
    "   -  can also use optional `else` and `finally` blocks along with `try`...`except`. The `else` block contains code that runs if no exceptions occur, while the `finally` block contains code that always executes, whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "   except SomeException as e:\n",
    "       # Handle SomeException\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       # Code that runs if no exceptions occurred\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Cleanup or finalization code that always runs\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This matching process based on the type (class) of the raised exception allows you to handle exceptions selectively and provide specific error-handling logic for different types of exceptions in your Python code. It helps in writing robust and maintainable programs with well-defined exception handling."

    "Attaching context information to exception artifacts is essential for enhancing the understandability and debugging of errors in your Python code. Here are two common methods for attaching context information to exception artifacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Exception Classes with Context Attributes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   One of the most flexible and recommended approaches is to create custom exception classes that inherit from built-in exceptions and include additional attributes to store context information. These attributes can provide details about the error, such as the source of the error, the input data, or any relevant state information. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, message, context=None):\n",
    "           super().__init__(message)\n",
    "           self.context = context\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "       if some_condition:\n",
    "           raise CustomError(\"An error occurred\", context={\"value\": some_value})\n",
    "   except CustomError as e:\n",
    "       # Access and use the context information\n",
    "       print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "       if e.context:\n",
    "           print(f\"Context: {e.context}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `CustomError` class includes a `context` attribute that can hold a dictionary or any other data structure containing context information. When an exception of this type is raised, you can pass relevant context information when creating the exception instance. Later, in the exception handler, you can access and use this context information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using the `from` Clause to Wrap Exceptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Another method is to use the `from` clause when raising exceptions to wrap one exception in another while preserving the original exception's context. This allows you to create a new exception with additional context information and associate it with the original exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "       if some_condition:\n",
    "           raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
    "   except ValueError as original_exception:\n",
    "       # Wrap the original exception with additional context\n",
    "       new_exception = RuntimeError(\"Error with context\") from original_exception\n",
    "       raise new_exception\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, when a `ValueError` is raised, the code wraps it in a new `RuntimeError` exception using the `from` clause. The `RuntimeError` includes the original `ValueError` as its cause, preserving the context of the original exception. This allows you to provide additional context information while retaining the details of the original exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these methods provide ways to attach context information to exception artifacts, making it easier to diagnose and understand the causes of exceptions in your code. The choice between them depends on your specific requirements and how you prefer to structure your custom exception handling logic."

    "the text of an exception object's error message in Python using two main methods: by passing a message string as an argument when raising the exception and by defining a custom exception class with a custom `__str__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Passing a Message String When Raising an Exception**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   When you raise an exception using the `raise` statement, you can include an error message as a string argument. This message provides additional information about the exception and helps in identifying the cause of the error. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",

    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",

    "   except ValueError as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, when the `ValueError` exception is raised, it includes the error message \"Invalid input: some_condition is True.\" This message can be accessed using the `str(e)` method, where `e` is the exception instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining a Custom Exception Class with a `__str__` Method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Another method is to define a custom exception class that inherits from a built-in exception class (e.g., `Exception`, `ValueError`) and override the `__str__` method to provide a custom error message. This allows you to create exception classes with customized error messages. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "           super().__init__(message)\n",

    "       def __str__(self):\n",
    "           return f\"CustomError: {self.args[0]}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that may raise a custom exception\n",
    "       if some_condition:\n",
    "           raise CustomError(\"An error occurred: some_condition is True\")\n",
    "   except CustomError as e:\n",
    "       print(e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `CustomError` class includes a custom `__str__` method that formats the error message as \"CustomError: [message].\" When you raise an instance of this exception class with a message, the `__str__` method is automatically called to provide the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these methods allow you to specify the text of an exception object's error message, providing valuable information about the nature of the error. The choice between them depends on whether you need custom exception classes with consistent error message formatting or if you want to specify error messages directly when raising exceptions."

    "String-based exceptions, also known as \"string exceptions,\" were used in older versions of Python (Python 2.x) to raise and catch exceptions by using plain strings as exception identifiers. However, this approach is considered outdated and is no longer recommended for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limited Information**: String-based exceptions provided limited information about the nature of the error. Using plain strings as exception identifiers didn't allow for the inclusion of additional error details, such as the error message or context, making it challenging to diagnose and handle exceptions effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lack of Consistency**: With string-based exceptions, there was no consistent way to organize or categorize exceptions. Different developers or libraries might use different string identifiers for similar error conditions, leading to inconsistency and confusion in exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Inheritance Hierarchy**: String-based exceptions didn't support creating custom exception hierarchies. In contrast, modern exception handling in Python relies on class-based exceptions, where custom exceptions can be organized in hierarchies, allowing for more structured and precise exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inefficiency**: String-based exceptions were less efficient than class-based exceptions. Exception handling with strings involved searching through a list of string identifiers to find a matching exception, which could be slower compared to the efficient lookup mechanism provided by class-based exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Less Type Safety**: String-based exceptions lacked type safety. With class-based exceptions, you can catch exceptions based on their type (class), ensuring that you handle specific exception types correctly. String-based exceptions relied on the accuracy of string matching, which could lead to errors if a string was misspelled or changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Limited Extensibility**: Extending or customizing string-based exceptions was less straightforward and less flexible compared to creating custom exception classes with class-based exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations and provide a more robust and structured approach to exception handling, Python introduced class-based exceptions in Python 2.5 and later. Class-based exceptions offer several advantages, including better error messages, improved organization, the ability to create custom exception hierarchies, and stronger type safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, class-based exceptions are the recommended and modern way to handle exceptions in Python, offering improved readability, organization, and flexibility compared to the outdated string-based exceptions. Therefore, string-based exceptions are no longer used in modern Python programming practices."
