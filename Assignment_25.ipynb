This means that the elements are generated only as needed, making it more memory-efficient for larger input sequences.

This allows generator functions to produce a series of values, one at a time, and to resume their execution between each value. The yield statement makes generator functions lazy in the sense that they don't generate all values at once but instead generate values on demand."
