Python lists, in contrast, can hold elements of varying data types.\n",

    "Both the `array` module and the NumPy library in Python are used for working with arrays, but they have several key differences in terms of functionality, performance, and flexibility. Here are the main differences between the `array` module and NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Type Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - `array`: The `array` module requires you to specify a data type when creating an array, and all elements in the array must have the same data type. This makes it less flexible when dealing with mixed data types.\n",
    "   - NumPy: NumPy arrays allow for a much greater flexibility in terms of data types. You can create arrays that contain elements of different data types, and NumPy provides a wide range of data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers, and custom data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Array Size Flexibility:**\n",
    "   - `array`: Arrays created using the `array` module have a fixed size once they are created. You cannot dynamically resize them by adding or removing elements.\n",
    "   - NumPy: NumPy arrays are more flexible in terms of size. You can easily resize NumPy arrays by adding or removing elements, which is especially useful for dynamic data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance:**\n",
    "   - `array`: The `array` module can offer better memory efficiency and performance for certain numerical computations compared to Python lists because it enforces a specific data type.\n",
    "   - NumPy: NumPy is designed specifically for numerical and scientific computing and provides highly optimized array operations. It often outperforms the `array` module and Python lists in terms of both speed and memory usage for numerical tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Functionality:**\n",
    "   - `array`: The `array` module provides a limited set of basic array operations, and it lacks many advanced functions that are available in NumPy.\n",
    "   - NumPy: NumPy offers a comprehensive set of functions for array manipulation, mathematical operations, linear algebra, statistics, and more. It is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis due to its extensive functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **External Libraries Compatibility:**\n",
    "   - `array`: The `array` module is a part of the Python standard library and does not integrate as seamlessly with external libraries like SciPy, scikit-learn, and others compared to NumPy.\n",
    "   - NumPy: NumPy is the foundation for many scientific computing libraries in Python, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration with various external libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Community and Ecosystem:**\n",
    "   - `array`: The `array` module is a basic component of Python, but it doesn't have as extensive a community or ecosystem as NumPy.\n",
    "   - NumPy: NumPy has a large and active community of users and developers, and it is widely adopted in scientific, engineering, and data analysis domains. This means you can find extensive documentation, tutorials, and community support for NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while both the `array` module and NumPy are used for working with arrays, NumPy offers more flexibility, better performance, and a richer set of features, making it the preferred choice for numerical and scientific computing tasks. The `array` module may still be useful in cases where you need a basic, memory-efficient array with a fixed data type and size, but for most numerical computing needs, NumPy is the recommended choice."

This means that the scalar value (n) is added to each element of the array A individually, creating a new array with the same shape as A.\n",
    "\n",

    "The best way to use a Boolean array to mask (or filter) another array in NumPy is to perform Boolean indexing. This technique allows you to use a Boolean array as a mask to select elements from another array based on a specified condition. Here are the steps to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Boolean array that defines the condition or criteria for selecting elements from the target array. This Boolean array should have the same shape as the target array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the Boolean array as an index to select elements from the target array. NumPy will return only the elements where the corresponding value in the Boolean array is `True`.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a NumPy array\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Boolean array based on a condition (e.g., select even numbers)\n",
    "condition = arr % 2 == 0\n",

    "result = arr[condition]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we first create a Boolean array `condition` that checks if each element of `arr` is even. Then, we use this Boolean array to index `arr`, which results in a new array containing only the elements where `condition` is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `result` array will contain the even numbers from the original `arr`, and the output will be:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points to keep in mind when using Boolean indexing to mask arrays:\n",

    "- The Boolean array used for indexing must have the same shape (or compatible shape according to broadcasting rules) as the target array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use various conditions to create the Boolean array, making it a powerful tool for filtering data based on different criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boolean indexing creates a new array that contains the selected elements, so it does not modify the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also combine multiple conditions using logical operators (e.g., `&` for \"and\" and `|` for \"or\") when creating the Boolean array.\n",

    "Calculating the standard deviation of a collection of data in Python can be done using standard Python, the `math` module, or the `numpy` library. Here are three different ways to compute the standard deviation, sorted by execution speed from fastest to slowest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NumPy (`numpy.std`):**\n",
    "   - NumPy is a powerful library for numerical and scientific computing in Python, and it provides a highly optimized implementation for calculating the standard deviation.\n",
    "   - Using `numpy.std` is generally the fastest and most efficient way to compute the standard deviation for large collections of data, especially when dealing with large datasets or multidimensional arrays.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import numpy as np\n",
    "     \n",
    "     data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "     std_dev = np.std(data)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Statistics Module (`statistics.stdev`):**\n",
    "   - The `statistics` module in Python's standard library provides a function called `stdev` for calculating the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "   - While it's a standard library function and doesn't require external packages, it may be slower than NumPy for larger datasets.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import statistics\n",
    "     \n",
    "     data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "     std_dev = statistics.stdev(data)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Custom Calculation (Using `math`):**\n",
    "   - You can calculate the standard deviation manually using the `math` module, but this method involves more code and is typically slower for large datasets.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import math\n",
    "     \n",
    "     data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "     n = len(data)\n",
    "     mean = sum(data) / n\n",
    "     squared_diff = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in data]\n",
    "     std_dev = math.sqrt(sum(squared_diff) / (n - 1))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, if you prioritize execution speed, using `numpy.std` is generally the fastest and most efficient way to calculate the standard deviation for a wide collection of data, especially when working with large datasets. The `statistics.stdev` function from the standard library can also be a good choice for smaller datasets, as it provides a convenient and straightforward way to calculate the standard deviation. Using manual calculations with the `math` module should be reserved for situations where you cannot use external libraries or need a custom implementation for specific requirements."

    "The dimensionality (or shape) of a Boolean mask-generated array in NumPy depends on the shape of the original array and the shape of the Boolean mask used for indexing. When you use a Boolean mask to index an array, the resulting array (the masked array) will have the same dimensionality as the Boolean mask itself.\n",

    "1. **1D Original Array and 1D Boolean Mask:**\n",
    "   - If the original array is 1-dimensional (1D), and you use a 1D Boolean mask for indexing, the resulting masked array will also be 1D.\n",

    "     ```python\n",

    "     arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",

    "2. **2D Original Array and 2D Boolean Mask:**\n",
    "   - If the original array is 2-dimensional (2D), and you use a 2D Boolean mask for indexing, the resulting masked array will also be 2D.\n",

    "     masked_arr = arr[mask]  # Resulting masked array is 2D\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **3D Original Array and 3D Boolean Mask:**\n",
    "   - Similarly, if the original array is 3-dimensional (3D), and you use a 3D Boolean mask for indexing, the resulting masked array will also be 3D.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import numpy as np\n",
    "     \n",
    "     arr = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])\n",

    "     masked_arr = arr[mask]  # Resulting masked array is 3D\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the dimensionality of a Boolean mask-generated array matches the dimensionality of the Boolean mask itself. This behavior allows you to selectively extract elements or subarrays from the original array based on the condition specified by the Boolean mask while preserving the shape and structure of the mask-generated array."
