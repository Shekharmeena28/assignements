    "To support iteration in your Python classes, you can implement two operator overloading methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `__iter__`: This method should be defined in your class to make an instance iterable. It should return an iterator object, typically `self`, and can include any initialization logic required for iteration. The `__iter__` method is called once when an iteration begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `__next__`: This method should be defined in the same class as `__iter__`. It is responsible for returning the next item in the iteration sequence. When there are no more items to iterate, it should raise the `StopIteration` exception to signal the end of the iteration.\n",
    "\n",

    "            result = self.current\n",
    "            self.current += 1\n",
    "            return result\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise StopIteration\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an instance of MyIterable\n",
    "my_iterable = MyIterable(1, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterating over the instance using a for loop\n",
    "for item in my_iterable:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `MyIterable` class defines the `__iter__` method, which initializes the iteration by setting the `current` attribute to the starting value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__next__` method returns the next item in the sequence and increments it until it reaches the end value. When there are no more items to iterate, it raises `StopIteration` to signal the end of the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We create an instance of `MyIterable` and use it in a `for` loop for iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing `__iter__` and `__next__` methods, you can make instances of your class iterable, allowing you to use them in `for` loops and other iteration contexts."

    "\n",
    "1. **`__str__` Method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Context**: The `__str__` method is used to define the \"informal\" or user-friendly string representation of an object. It is typically used in contexts where a human-readable representation of the object is desired, such as when you use the `str()` function or when you print an object directly using the `print()` function.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - **Usage**: This method should return a string that represents the object in a way that, when passed to the `eval()` function or used in Python code, can recreate an object with the same state. It is commonly used for debugging and development.\n",

    "     print(repr(obj))  # Output: \"MyClass()\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `repr()` function is commonly used to obtain the `__repr__` representation of an object.\n",

    "Operator overloading in Python is appropriate in several situations where it can enhance the clarity, readability, and expressiveness of your code. However, it should be used judiciously and with careful consideration. Here are some scenarios when it is appropriate to use operator overloading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Natural Semantics**: When overloading an operator aligns with the natural semantics of the objects you are working with. For example, overloading the `+` operator for adding two complex numbers or vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Readability**: Operator overloading can make code more readable and intuitive. When using operators makes the code clearer and more concise than alternative methods, it can be a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency with Built-in Types**: When you want your custom objects to behave similarly to built-in types or other standard libraries that use the same operators. This consistency can make your code more user-friendly and Pythonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Domain Modeling**: If you are modeling a specific domain or problem, and overloading operators would make your code more closely resemble the problem domain, it can lead to a more intuitive and expressive design.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: Operator overloading can reduce the need for boilerplate code. Instead of writing custom methods for every operation, you can use familiar operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Compatibility**: When you want instances of your class to be compatible with Python's built-in functions and libraries that rely on operators. For example, supporting iteration with the `__getitem__` method allows your object to work with `for` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Specialized Libraries**: When developing specialized libraries or frameworks, operator overloading can provide a convenient and consistent interface for library users.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Custom Containers**: When creating custom container classes (e.g., lists, sets, or dictionaries) and you want them to behave like standard containers, overloading operators can help achieve that.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Mathematical or Scientific Computing**: In mathematical or scientific computing applications, operator overloading can make code more concise and readable when working with mathematical objects and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to exercise caution when overloading operators. Overloading should enhance code clarity and maintain consistency, not introduce confusion or deviate too far from common expectations. Additionally, comprehensive documentation of the behavior of overloaded operators is essential to avoid surprises for users of your classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, operator overloading is appropriate when it improves code readability, aligns with natural semantics, maintains consistency, and enhances the expressiveness of your code. However, it should be used thoughtfully and in contexts where it genuinely adds value to your codebase."
